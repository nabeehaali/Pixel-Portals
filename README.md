# Pixel-Portals
 A new twist on the classic arcade game "Pacman"! The player must avoid the ghosts while navigating a maze to collect 5 pieces unlocking a portal to the next level. Mini portals within the maze can help the player make strategic decisions, whether by teleporting to another location, reversing time, or becoming invisible to ghosts for a limited period of time.
